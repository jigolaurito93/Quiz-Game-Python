# Quiz-Game-Python

This project is called Quiz Game and I used Python to build this code.
It is a trivia game which asks the user for an input which can only be answer by True or False
This game is built using Object Oriented Programming 
The 12 questions were randomly selected using a website called Open Trivia Database https://opentdb.com/
I used a For Loop to iterate the questions to display
